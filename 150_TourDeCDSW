If you can read this inside CDSW/CML you already created a project
Please take a quick look at 
 Kerberos credentials entry
 LDAP settings screen - you can only see this if you have admin rights... please don't change anything!
 The Dashboard meters showing resource utilization, if your hardware has GPUs you'll get a GPU resource meter
 Left panel: projects, jobs, sessions, settings, admin
 
You can refresh the files in this project by opening the "terminal access" and doing:
git pull    
at the command line. This is also how you can access a private GitHub
 
You are now ready to run different examples. It is easiset to run
in sequential order.  
The first example: 200_Basic_HelloR.r  
This is a simple hello world in R
 Open the file
 Open workbench
 Select Session type: R, python, scala... for an R file you'll want an R environment
 Select Session size: cpu and ram resources
 Start R session
 Publish your session with the link in the upper right hand corner.  The session
  publication is a great teaming feature
 Check dashboard for utilization

Run more of the examples... when you run the python examples you'll need to create a 
 python session
When in pyspark - check out CM, you can see your session running
Jobs - schedule when to run workload

Fork a project!  Notice all the libraries are in place and the code runs.  You will 
need adequate HDFS permissions to access the data for the project

Very powerful model deployment - create a "python template" project and then 
follow the instructions here to deploy a model you can call from a REST endpoint

Todo: add a flask app example
